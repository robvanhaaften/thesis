import pandas as pd

# import dhs survey data
# source: https://www.dhsprogram.com/data/dataset/Uganda_Standard-DHS_2016.cfm?flag=0
df = pd.read_stata(r"C:\Users\Rob\Dropbox\My PC (DESKTOP-DP7OCOF)\Desktop\GIS_thesis\01_thesis_data\01_input\04_DHS\Uganda_2016_HH_recode\UGHR7BFL.DTA", convert_categoricals=False)


# keep the household id, cluster id and combined wealth index 
ug_dhs_wi = df[["hhid","hv001", "hv271"]]
ug_dhs_wi.rename(columns = {"hv001":"cluster", "hv271":"wi"}, inplace=True)

#group by cluster by taking mean of households in each cluster 
ug_dhs_wi = ug_dhs_wi.groupby(by = "cluster").mean()

###FINAL FIX: change this to \02temp 
ug_dhs_wi.to_csv(r"C:\Users\Rob\Dropbox\My PC (DESKTOP-DP7OCOF)\Desktop\GIS_thesis\01_thesis_data\02_temp\05_dhs\ug_dhs_wi.csv", index = True)
